# A collection of ipython notebooks 
- `quantile_regression`: an implementation of the quantile regression with
  *pytorch* 
- `KalmanFiltering`: using particle filtering to infer the hidden states of a Kalman filter with deterministic emission
- `Sampling`: trying some sampling algorithm other than the particle filtering
  used in the `Kalman-Filtering` notebook
